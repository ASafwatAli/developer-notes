# Big Data Tools and Technologies

## Apache Hadoop

Hadoop is a very significant player in the Big Data landscape.

It's an open-sourced framework for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets.

Originally built in 2005 by a Yahoo engineer.

It was inspired by Google's `MapReduce` and the `Google File System` papers.
