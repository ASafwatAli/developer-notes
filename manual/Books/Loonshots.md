# Loonshots

## Bush-Vail Rules

### 1. Separate the phases

- Seperate your artists and soldiers
- Tailor the tools to the phase
- Watch your blind side: nurture both types of loonshots

### 2. Create dynamic equilibrium

- Love your artists and soldiers equally
- Manage the transfer, not the tech: be a gardener, not a Moses
- Appoint and train project champions to bridge the divide
