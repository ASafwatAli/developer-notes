# Loonshots

## Bush-Vail Rules

### 1. Separate the phases

- Seperate your artists and soldiers
- Tailor the tools to the phase
- Watch your blind side: nurture both types of loonshots

### 2. Create dynamic equilibrium

- Love your artists and soldiers equally
- Manage the transfer, not the tech: be a gardener, not a Moses
- Appoint and train project champions to bridge the divide

### 3. Spread a system mindset

- Keep asking why the organisation made the choices that it did
- Keep asking how the decision-making process can be improved
- Identify teams with outcome mindset and help them adopt system mindset

### 4. Raise the magic number

- Reduce return-on-politics
- Use soft equity (nonfinancial awards)
- Increase project-skill fit (scan for mismatches)
- Fix the middle (reduce perverse incentives for middle managers)
- Bring a gun to a knife fight (engage a chief incentives officer)
- Fine-tune the spans (wide for loonshots for groups; narrow for franchise)
