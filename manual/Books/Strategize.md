# Strategize

## Rough Notes

### Core, Adjacent and Disruptive innovations:

- Core: Optimizing existing products for established markets. Draws on skills and assets the company already has in place and makes incremental changes to current products.
- Adjacent: Leveraging something your company does well into a new space.
- Disruptive: Solves a customer problem in a better, more convenient, cheaper way than alternatives.

### Customer Segments

- Customer-first attribute segments: when making core innovations.
- Benefit-first segments: when making adjacent or disruptive innovations.
- Avoid these two mistakes:
  1. Don't blindly follow predefined segments.
  2. Don't discard an idea because it does not fit into predefined segments.
- A good way to measure Market Segments is to use the `GE/McKinsey Matrix`. This is a XY scatter plot that pits `Business Strength` on the X axis vs `Segment Attractiveness` on the Y axis (both from low to high).
  - Determining Attractivesness:
    - Need
    - Segment size
    - Growth rate
    - Competitors
    - Entry barriers

### Personas

- Don't clutter personas with irrelevant characteristics, attitudes and behaviours.

### Find an itch that worth scratching 

- Understand why people would want to buy and use it.
- The product must be `sticky`.
- Vitamins: Products like Sonos that don't solve a pain or urgeny need. A nice-to-have.
- Painkillers: Products that address a problem like Bing or Google Search.
