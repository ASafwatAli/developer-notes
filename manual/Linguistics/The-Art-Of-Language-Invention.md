# The Art Of Language Invention

## Morphology

Inflectional morphology has to do with changes to a word that don't affect its grammatical category (ie whether it is a noun or a verb or an adjective). An example would be a noun pluralization: man, men.

Derivational morphology is the oppositive. When you change a word graphic (noun) to graphical (adjective) you have derived the second word from the first.

## Affixes

A cover term for any type of phonological string that has been added to a base word to create a new, modified word.

| Affix     | Definition                   | Example                |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prefix    | Added before base word       | "Re"-do                |
| Suffix    | Added after base word        | Punch-"ed"             |
| Circumfix | Combination of prefix/suffix | "E"-long-"ated"        |
| Infix     | Inserted into middle of word | In-"freaking"-credible |

## Apophony

Cover term that refers to any type of word-internal process used to effect a change in a word (either inflectional or derivational) - the irregular plural of goose, geese is an example.

## Suppletion

When two forms that should be related are not related at all. Example being "good", "better". There is no relationship at all other than that they belong to the same paradigm.

## Reduplication

When part of all of a word is repeated for mophological reasons: "lovey-dovey", "ooey-gooey".

## Paradigm

A set of inflectional forms eg short, shorter, shortest.

## Exponence

A cover term to refer to the reification or instantiation of any inflectional or derivational category. In geese, the exponence is the apophony whereby oo becomes ee.

## No Marking in languages

Some languages make no morphological distinction between singular and plural outside of a a couple of instances. Nouns in Mandarin Chinese are netiher singular nor plural; the only place where plural marking exists obligatorily is in the pronoun system.

## Subjects and Objects in Grammatical Contexts

"David" being the change context.

| Sentence                                    | Context         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| David loves the cat.                        | Subject         |
| The cat loves David                         | Object          |
| The cat often brings her string to David    | Indirect Object |
| The cat is a fan of David                   | Possessor       |
| The cat sits on David                       | Location        |
| The cat likes to walk downstairs with David | Companion       |
| David! Go feed the cat!                     | Addressee       |

## Nominal Inflection

Inflecting words based on a numeral value ie one man vs two men.

| Name         | Definition                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Dual         | Two or an item                                        |
| Trial        | Three of an item                                      |
| Paucal       | A few of some item                                    |
| Collective   | A large group of some item                            |
| Singulative  | Substance whose most basic form is plural or masslike |
| Distributive | Plural entity that's evenly divided between a group   |

An example for distributive would be inflection that demonstrates something like "our horses (each of us has one horse)" as is the case for that example in Southern Paiute.

## Definitive vs Indefinite Articles

"A" in itself in indefinite and can only accompany a singular noun (although not the case with all languages), "the" is a definite articular referring to a particular instance of a noun. In English, the presence of a definite article has no bearing on the form of a noun in singular or plural form.
