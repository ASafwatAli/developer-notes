# The Art Of Language Invention

## Morphology

Inflectional morphology has to do with changes to a word that don't affect its grammatical category (ie whether it is a noun or a verb or an adjective). An example would be a noun pluralization: man, men.

Derivational morphology is the oppositive. When you change a word graphic (noun) to graphical (adjective) you have derived the second word from the first.

## Affixes

A cover term for any type of phonological string that has been added to a base word to create a new, modified word.

| Affix     | Definition                   | Example                |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prefix    | Added before base word       | "Re"-do                |
| Suffix    | Added after base word        | Punch-"ed"             |
| Circumfix | Combination of prefix/suffix | "E"-long-"ated"        |
| Infix     | Inserted into middle of word | In-"freaking"-credible |

## Apophony

Cover term that refers to any type of word-internal process used to effect a change in a word (either inflectional or derivational) - the irregular plural of goose, geese is an example.

## Suppletion

When two forms that should be related are not related at all. Example being "good", "better".
