# The Art Of Language Invention

## Morphology

Inflectional morphology has to do with changes to a word that don't affect its grammatical category (ie whether it is a noun or a verb or an adjective). An example would be a noun pluralization: man, men.

Derivational morphology is the oppositive. When you change a word graphic (noun) to graphical (adjective) you have derived the second word from the first.

## Affixes

A cover term for any type of phonological string that has been added to a base word to create a new, modified word.
