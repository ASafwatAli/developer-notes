# Composite Pattern

The `Composite Pattern` is a Gang Of Four structural Design Pattern that helps solve the following problems:

1. A part-whole hierarchy should be represented so that clients can treat part and whole objects uniformly.
2. A part-whole hierarcy should be represented as tree structure.

The Composite pattern will describe the following:

- A unified `Component` interface for both part (Leaf) objects and whole (Composite) objects.
- Individual `Leaf` objects implement the `Component` interface directly, and `Composite` objects forward requests to their child components.
