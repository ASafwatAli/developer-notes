# Iterator

A behavioural pattern that is used to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without a required understanding of the underlying representation.

## Components

- ConcreteIterator: An interface to define how the `next` and `hasNext` methods work.
- ConcreteCollection: A collection that has knowledge of the iterator and creates the iterator.

## Example

```typescript
```
