## 1. Clarify Requirements

It is always a good idea to ask questions about the exact scope of the problem we are solving.

- Design questions are mostly open-ended, and they don’t have ONE correct answer, that’s why clarifying ambiguities early in the interview becomes critical.
- Candidates who spend enough time to define the end goals of the system always have a better chance to be successful in the interview.
- Also, since we only have 35-40 minutes to design a (supposedly) large system, we should clarify what parts of the system we will be focusing on.
