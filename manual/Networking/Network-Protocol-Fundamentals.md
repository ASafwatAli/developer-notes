# Network Protocol Fundamentals

Protocol = a set of rules. When we talk about network protocols, this means the formal standards and policies that define the way two or more devices communicate on a network.

Early examples include telegrams, radio, etc.

- Network communication happens at different levels or layers (OSI model and TCP/IP model)
- Each layer of network communication is responsible for passing the information on to the next layer in the stack
- Data transferred between layers in known as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
- These network layers of communication allows for better troubleshooting
- The rise of the internet and new technology has changed the way devices communicate with each other, new technologies sometimes require the development of new protocols
- As protocols are created or improved, older protocols become outdated and unsecure
