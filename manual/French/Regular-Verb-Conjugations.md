## Note on Imperfect Conjugation

The imperfect (abbreviated imperf) is a verb form which combines past tense (reference to a past time) and imperfective aspect (reference to a continuing or repeated event or state).

English has no general imperfective and expresses it in different ways. The term "imperfect" in English refers to forms much more commonly called past progressive or past continuous (like was doing or were doing).
