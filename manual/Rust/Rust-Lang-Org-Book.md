## Hello World

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Note: `println!` calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead, it would be entered as println (without the !). For now, you just need to know that using a ! means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function.

## Hello Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call libraries your code needs dependencies.)
