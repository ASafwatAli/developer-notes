# Developer's Guide to TypeScript

## Types

For types, we have all our basic types and we can also have custom types.

There are two types, `primitive` and `object` - the `object` types itself can be what we define.

```javascript
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  completed: boolean;
};

const todo = obj.data as Todo;
```
