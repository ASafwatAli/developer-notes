# AWS IoT Overview

AWS IoT Allows for secure, two-way comms between AWS and IoT sensors, actuators, embedded micro-contollers or smart appliances.

Allows you to colelct and analyze data from multiple devices and create applications that enable users to control these devices.

We can connect the IoT devices using the SDKs provided by AWS. The device connection over MQTT or HTTP happens thanks to the IoT Device Gateway.
