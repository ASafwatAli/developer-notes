It's often used to build a data warehouse. During this process, data is taken (extracted) from a source system, converted (transformed) into a format that can be analyzed, and stored (loaded) into a data warehouse or other system. Extract, load, transform (ELT) is an alternate but related approach designed to push processing down to the database for improved performance.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"why-is-it-important\"\n    }}>{`Why is it important?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Businesses have relied on the ETL process for many years to get a consolidated view of the data that drives better business decisions.
